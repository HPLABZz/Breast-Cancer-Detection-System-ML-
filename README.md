# Breast Cancer Detection System (ML)

A machine learning-based system for early detection of breast cancer using clinical and diagnostic data. This project aims to assist in identifying malignant and benign tumors efficiently through automated predictions.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early diagnosis can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment. This project uses machine learning models to classify tumors as **Malignant** or **Benign** based on patient data.
